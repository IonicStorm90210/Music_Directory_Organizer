# Music_Directory_Organizer
This is a python script to organize audio files into directories based on artist and album name.
This script utilizes the python module Mutagen in order to retrieve the song file's metadata.

In order to organize any audio files, you will first have to provide the full folder path of the orignal folder that has the audio files you want to organize. 
Next, provide a full folder path to the new folder where the audio files will be organized into based on artist name > album name > song name.
